			You are starting to lose your mind. Between nightmares of eldritch creatures that prove too real for comfort to the fact your very presence brings an evil aura, the consequences of dabbling in the darker aspects of magic have driven you to the edge. In a last-ditch effort to regain your sanity, you hope to harness another, brighter and altogether more benevolent set of magic forces to drive away your demons. However, the final step will still need to use that infernal altar that gave you these problems in the first place. One can only hope this works, as it is your last chance...

			Two long-running themes in your pursuits are the quest for ever greater levels of power and your increasingly severe unwillingness to expend your resources to attain that power. So what better than a new capstone material for your wand, one that cuts the cost of usage by an enormous factor? Differently-tuned materials will yield different discounts, and if you can manage to unify all of them, something truly special would be possible.

			You should at this point be familiar enough with the various materials to guess which aspects will be improved by what material, and you can probably expect to fully halve the cost of the use of those aspects. Other aspects might see a smaller benefit as well, probably on the order of a one-fifth reduction.

			Be it your material reserves, your power storage, your food supply, or, as now, your wand capacity, it is never enough. The once-seemingly-vast hundred or two vis you managed to pack into a white wooden stick now show how small they truly are. Recalling your experiences with iridescent crystal and its amplification power on the Crystal Pylons, you wonder if you can find another use. It might even gain other special powers from doing so. Besides, what is the worst that could happen?

			Near every kind of construct you deal with has its own kind of tool to tune it; the machinery in your base alone has mandated four kinds of wrenches, two hammers, and a screwdriver. Magical constructs are no exception, with one set requiring what amounts to crystals on a stick, another being petals on a stick, and another...metals on a stick. Either way, the last of these can accept upgrades that add some kind of function, from digging to throwing fire to making your friend unable to remove random blocks from their base. Given this, as well as the fact that you have found out a way to imprint one such upgrade with one of your wrench variants, you might be able to replicate at least one of your other magical manipulation tools.
